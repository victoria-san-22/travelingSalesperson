# travelingSalesperson

This is a project I completed in my Software Development class at UA, CSC 210. You can see the overall project description here:


PURPOSE: This program is based on the famous NP-Complete Problem
Traveling Salesperson. Given a number of locations to visit, it
must attempt to find the shortest path one could take to visit
every location provided. This program tries three approaches 
to solve this problem: heuristic, recursive backtracking, and
an (attempted) improved version on the recursive backtracking
method. It also provides comparisons between each algorithm's
trip cost and runtime to give users a better idea of how
these approaches differ, especially in terms of correctness 
vs. efficiency.
